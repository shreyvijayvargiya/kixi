Hello and welcome

In today’s story, I’ll be bringing how developers and designers are using our [kixi.app](http://kixi.app) to build their online portfolio

The story begins with one of my FREE portfolio Starter Templates, which basically provides

- One code repository
- One JSON file to edit the content
- One click to deploy and put your portfolio live

After crossing 100+ sales all over the world on gumroad, the idea emerged for me to bring this concept to a single platform, and that is why [kixi.app](http://kixi.app) came into the picture.

kixi provides website templates, inspirations, and source code to quickly build your own online portfolio.

**20+ Portfolio Website Templates**

- Go to [kixi.app/portfolio](https://www.kixi.app/templates?category=portfolio)
- Simply find the portfolio you want to bring or make one
- Open the template, get the source code in React, Vite and Next
- Or download the Next and Vite code repository, customise the content
- And deploy your own portfolio instantly

**This process entirely**

- Saves time in prompting AI editors
- Provides professional designs and responsive source code
- Easy to customise, update and deploy

No more BS, and it's FREE to use. We do provide premium templates for the agencies, entrepreneurs as well, so do check if in need.
