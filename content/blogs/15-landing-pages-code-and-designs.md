Hello and Welcome

Hacktober Fest is already going, micro and mini SAAS ideas are plunging along with WHOOP apps (small micro apps), people/developers are using Vibe coding to build their next million $$$ idea using plain english

Everything is going fast, and startups now don't really wait for 3/4 weeks for one MVP; instead, they prefer launching at least a landing page on Day One to test the idea

[Joel shares an experience of launching a landing page](https://medium.com/@joelgascoigne/how-to-successfully-validate-your-idea-with-a-landing-page-mvp-ef3c2d02dc51) for early signups before building the actual product, also known as an MVP, and ends up getting over 20 signups and one paid member to try out his product. This approach is becoming a new strategy for idea validation, making things easy in the long run.

But one big question Jeol have is how to make high-converting landing pages

Key factors for high-converting landing pages

- Explains your idea within one page in a few words
- Propose the startup solution as a better alternative
- Call to action (Motivate visitors to sign up or test the product)
- Lays the feedback mechanism to know which problem to solve first and which one to push for later
- Faqa, pricing, subscribe form, calendar book meeting, payment page, etc

Each landing page deserves a bit of attention to make sure the problem and solution are well-explained

That's the real story for every solo founder, but one big problem all of them face is how to make a landing page, where to get inspiration?
We are living in 2025, and a simple design aggregator platform won't work well like dribbble(Of course, it works as one can take a screenshot and feed it to the LLM to generate similar landing pages 😁), but what if we get one dedicated platform for Designers, Developers and entrepreneurs? And that is why I built [kixi.app](kixi.app)

### 15 Landing pages code and designs

In total, we provide 14 landing pages along with source code in React and Nextjs and Vite that one can easily copy-paste into any Vibe code editor to quickly build.

[Landing Pages Templates](https://www.kixi.app/templates)

Every day I am releasing new components/templates/blocks that helps developers across the globe to bring their next idea into the world

Apart from landing pages, the categories we provide are as follows

- Payment pages
- Onboarding, login, signup
- Hero sections
- Tables, CRM, Admins
- Content like Docs, Blogs
- Editors like Tiptap editors, Notion-like editors
- Animations component and more

And that's it, more to come, check the [releases](https://www.kixi.app/releases) page for everyday releases.

That's it, see you in the next one
