Hello and welcome

I am Shrey, creator of [gettemplate.website](https://www.gettemplate.website)

It's a collection of React and Nextjs code templates for developers worldwide. I launched it 3 months ago, and last week, I pushed the new UI along with some premium templates as well

### Website Updates

- Website is now revamped with a new design and theme system
- Premium templates are added to buy the full-stack repositories with ready-to-use production-level code repositories

This entire process now helps developers to first copy-paste the basic, decent, and experienced React templates as well as components.

- Simply go to gettemplate.website/templates
- View the sidebar with all types/categories of templates
- Even Search for your choice
- Lastly, open the templates, click on view source to view the code in React, Next and Vite
- Or directly download the code repository

### Future Roadmaps

- Push code repository directly to your github repository
- AI code editor (If I can make it cheaper 😁)
- More premium templates to make some $$$
- Documentation page

That's it for today, do check the [website](https://gettemplate.website)
